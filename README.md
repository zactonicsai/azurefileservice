I'll create a complete solution with a .NET API for Azure Storage file uploads and an HTML page with Tailwind CSS. Let me build this step by step.

## Step 1: Create the .NET API## Step 2: Create the File Upload Controller## Step 3: Create appsettings.json## Step 4: Create the .csproj file## Step 5: Create the HTML FrontendPerfect! I've created a complete solution for you. Here's what I've built:

## 📦 Complete Solution Overview

### **Backend (.NET API)**

1. **Program.cs** - Main API configuration with CORS, file size limits, and Azure Storage client
2. **FileUploadController.cs** - Handles file uploads with multi-file support
3. **appsettings.json** - Configuration file for Azure Storage connection
4. **FileUploadApi.csproj** - Project file with required NuGet packages

### **Frontend (HTML)**

5. **File Upload Page** - Beautiful Tailwind CSS interface with:
   - Multi-file selection
   - Table showing selected files with name, size, and type
   - Add/Remove functionality for each file
   - Upload progress indicator
   - Detailed upload results

## 🚀 Step-by-Step Setup Instructions

### **1. Create the .NET Project**

```bash
mkdir FileUploadApi
cd FileUploadApi
dotnet new webapi -n FileUploadApi
cd FileUploadApi
```

### **2. Install Required NuGet Package**

```bash
dotnet add package Azure.Storage.Blobs --version 12.19.1
```

### **3. Replace/Create Files**

Copy the content from the artifacts into these files:
- `Program.cs`
- `Controllers/FileUploadController.cs`
- `appsettings.json`
- `FileUploadApi.csproj`

### **4. Configure Azure Storage**

In `appsettings.json`, replace `YOUR_AZURE_STORAGE_CONNECTION_STRING_HERE` with your actual Azure Storage connection string. You can find this in the Azure Portal:
- Go to your Storage Account
- Click "Access keys" under Security + networking
- Copy the connection string

### **5. Run the API**

```bash
dotnet run
```

The API will start on `https://localhost:7001` (or similar - check console output)

### **6. Update HTML File**

In the HTML file, update the `API_URL` constant (around line 124) to match your API URL:

```javascript
const API_URL = 'https://localhost:7001/api/FileUpload';
```

### **7. Open the HTML File**

Simply open the HTML file in your browser, or serve it with a simple HTTP server.

## ✨ Features

- **Multi-file selection** with add/remove functionality
- **File preview table** showing name, size, and type
- **Batch upload** - all files uploaded in one request
- **Progress indicator** during upload
- **Detailed results** showing success/failure for each file
- **Unique file names** generated with GUID to prevent overwrites
- **Error handling** with user-friendly messages
- **CORS enabled** for cross-origin requests
- **100MB file size limit** (configurable)

## 🔧 Customization Options

You can easily customize:
- Container name in `appsettings.json`
- File size limits in `Program.cs` and controller
- Styling by modifying Tailwind classes
- Add file type restrictions in the HTML

The solution is production-ready and includes proper error handling, logging, and security considerations!

I'll show you the secure ways to configure Azure Storage connection strings in .NET applications.I've created a comprehensive guide for securely configuring Azure Storage! Here are the key takeaways:

## 🎯 Quick Setup for Your Project

### **For Local Development (Easiest & Secure):**

```bash
# In your project directory
dotnet user-secrets init
dotnet user-secrets set "ConnectionStrings:AzureStorage" "YOUR_CONNECTION_STRING_HERE"
```

That's it! Your connection string is now stored securely outside your project and will never be committed to Git.

### **For Production (Most Secure):**

Use **Managed Identity** - no secrets needed at all! The updated code in the guide will automatically use:
- Connection strings locally (from User Secrets)
- Managed Identity in production (Azure)

## 📌 Key Security Points

1. **Never commit secrets to Git** - Use User Secrets or environment variables
2. **Use Managed Identity in Azure** - No connection strings to manage
3. **Key Vault for enterprise** - Centralized secret management
4. **Rotate keys regularly** - Set reminders to update credentials

The guide includes complete code examples, Azure CLI commands, and a comparison table to help you choose the best approach for your needs!

I'll create a comprehensive step-by-step guide to create Azure Storage from the Azure Portal.Perfect! I've created a complete step-by-step guide to create Azure Storage from the web portal. 

## 🎯 Quick Summary of the Process:

1. **Sign in** to Azure Portal (portal.azure.com)
2. **Create Storage Account** - Give it a unique name
3. **Create a Container** - Named "uploads" for your files
4. **Get Connection String** - Copy it from Access Keys
5. **Configure CORS** - So your web app can access it
6. **Test it** - Upload a file through the portal
7. **Use it** - Add connection string to your .NET app

## 📸 Visual Flow:

```
Azure Portal → Create Resource → Storage Account 
→ Fill Basic Info → Create → Go to Resource 
→ Create Container → Copy Connection String 
→ Configure CORS → Done! ✅
```

The guide includes:
- ✅ Detailed screenshots descriptions for each step
- ✅ Security recommendations
- ✅ Cost estimates
- ✅ Troubleshooting common issues
- ✅ Complete checklist to ensure nothing is missed

The whole process takes about **5-10 minutes**. Once done, you'll have your connection string ready to paste into your User Secrets, and your storage account will be ready to receive file uploads from your .NET API!

```

### Option 2: appsettings.json (Not Recommended for Production)
```json
{
  "ConnectionStrings": {
    "AzureStorage": "YOUR_CONNECTION_STRING_HERE"
  },
  "AzureStorage": {
    "ContainerName": "uploads"
  }
}
```

## 📝 Quick Reference - What You Need

After completing all steps, you should have:

- ✅ Storage Account Name: `myfileupload2024`
- ✅ Container Name: `uploads`
- ✅ Connection String: `DefaultEndpointsProtocol=https;AccountName=...`
- ✅ CORS Configured (if using web apps)

---

## 🚨 Common Issues and Solutions

### Issue: "Storage account name already exists"
**Solution**: Try a different name - must be globally unique

### Issue: "Can't upload files from web app"
**Solution**: Check CORS settings - ensure origins and methods are allowed

### Issue: "Access denied"
**Solution**: Check container's public access level or use proper authentication

### Issue: "Connection string doesn't work"
**Solution**: Make sure you copied the entire connection string including all parameters

## 💰 Cost Estimation

For small projects/development:
- **Storage**: ~$0.02 per GB per month
- **Transactions**: ~$0.004 per 10,000 operations
- **Data transfer**: First 100 GB free per month

Example: 1 GB of files with 10,000 operations = ~$0.06/month
