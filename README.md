I'll create a complete solution with a .NET API for Azure Storage file uploads and an HTML page with Tailwind CSS. Let me build this step by step.

## Step 1: Create the .NET API## Step 2: Create the File Upload Controller## Step 3: Create appsettings.json## Step 4: Create the .csproj file## Step 5: Create the HTML FrontendPerfect! I've created a complete solution for you. Here's what I've built:

## ðŸ“¦ Complete Solution Overview

### **Backend (.NET API)**

1. **Program.cs** - Main API configuration with CORS, file size limits, and Azure Storage client
2. **FileUploadController.cs** - Handles file uploads with multi-file support
3. **appsettings.json** - Configuration file for Azure Storage connection
4. **FileUploadApi.csproj** - Project file with required NuGet packages

### **Frontend (HTML)**

5. **File Upload Page** - Beautiful Tailwind CSS interface with:
   - Multi-file selection
   - Table showing selected files with name, size, and type
   - Add/Remove functionality for each file
   - Upload progress indicator
   - Detailed upload results

## ðŸš€ Step-by-Step Setup Instructions

### **1. Create the .NET Project**

```bash
mkdir FileUploadApi
cd FileUploadApi
dotnet new webapi -n FileUploadApi
cd FileUploadApi
```

### **2. Install Required NuGet Package**

```bash
dotnet add package Azure.Storage.Blobs --version 12.19.1
```

### **3. Replace/Create Files**

Copy the content from the artifacts into these files:
- `Program.cs`
- `Controllers/FileUploadController.cs`
- `appsettings.json`
- `FileUploadApi.csproj`

### **4. Configure Azure Storage**

In `appsettings.json`, replace `YOUR_AZURE_STORAGE_CONNECTION_STRING_HERE` with your actual Azure Storage connection string. You can find this in the Azure Portal:
- Go to your Storage Account
- Click "Access keys" under Security + networking
- Copy the connection string

### **5. Run the API**

```bash
dotnet run
```

The API will start on `https://localhost:7001` (or similar - check console output)

### **6. Update HTML File**

In the HTML file, update the `API_URL` constant (around line 124) to match your API URL:

```javascript
const API_URL = 'https://localhost:7001/api/FileUpload';
```

### **7. Open the HTML File**

Simply open the HTML file in your browser, or serve it with a simple HTTP server.

## âœ¨ Features

- **Multi-file selection** with add/remove functionality
- **File preview table** showing name, size, and type
- **Batch upload** - all files uploaded in one request
- **Progress indicator** during upload
- **Detailed results** showing success/failure for each file
- **Unique file names** generated with GUID to prevent overwrites
- **Error handling** with user-friendly messages
- **CORS enabled** for cross-origin requests
- **100MB file size limit** (configurable)

## ðŸ”§ Customization Options

You can easily customize:
- Container name in `appsettings.json`
- File size limits in `Program.cs` and controller
- Styling by modifying Tailwind classes
- Add file type restrictions in the HTML

The solution is production-ready and includes proper error handling, logging, and security considerations!
